Planning
========

The plan has a tree structure with six main sections:

* cloud pre-upgrade steps,
* control-plane principal applications upgrade
* control-plane subordinate applications upgrade
* data-plane hypervisors upgrade
* data-plane non-hypervisor principal applications upgrade
* data-plane subordinate applications upgrade
* cloud post-upgrade steps.

The above demonstrates a complete cloud upgrade plan. However, it's also possible to
target a specific subset of the cloud. For more information, please refer to
:doc:`Upgrade Groups <./upgrade-groups>`. 

The **pre-upgrade** steps prepare COU for the upgrade process, which includes
verifying the states or configurations of the applications, units, or of the
OpenStack cloud.

The **upgrade** steps are the main steps needed to run upgrades for each application.

The **post-upgrade** steps are responsible for making sure that the upgrade finishes
successfully.

The plan can also be obtained without the need to perform a cloud upgrade using
the **plan** command. See :doc:`Plan an upgrade <../how-to/plan-upgrade>`.

Different upgrade strategies are chosen for control-plane and data-plane applications
when preparing the plan. For details, please refer to :doc:`Upgrade <./upgrade>`.
